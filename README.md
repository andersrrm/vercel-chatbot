# AI Chatbot - Project Summary

## Model Changes
- Centralized and refactored types for better code organization and maintainability.
- Types for assistants and related components are now located in `lib/types.ts`.
- Improved code readability and structure across the project.

## Assistant Endpoints Implemented
- **Create Assistant**: `POST /api/assistants`  
  Allows creation of a new assistant with name, instructions, and avatar.
- **Update Assistant**: `PUT /api/assistants/[assistantId]`  
  Enables updating an existing assistant's details.
- **Delete Assistant**: `DELETE /api/assistants/[assistantId]`  
  Performs a soft delete on the assistant (marks as deleted, does not remove from DB).

## Pending Feature
- Sending a custom prompt to a specific assistant when chatting is not yet implemented. This feature is planned for future development.

## Tests
- Three simple unit tests are provided for the assistant endpoints:
  1. Create assistant
  2. Update assistant
  3. Soft delete assistant
- Tests are located in `tests/assistants.test.ts` and use mock data/functions for fast execution.

## Notes
- The codebase is now cleaner and more professional, with reusable and centralized types.
- The assistant endpoints are ready for integration with the rest of the chatbot system.
- Further improvements and features will be added iteratively as needed.
